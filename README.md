# Pavement crack detection: dataset and model
The project is used to share our recent work on pavement crack detection. For the details of the work, the readers are refer to the paper "Feature Pyramid and Hierarchical Boosting Network for Pavement Crack Detection" (FPHB), T-ITS 2019.
You can find the paper in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330244656_Feature_Pyramid_and_Hierarchical_Boosting_Network_for_Pavement_Crack_Detection or https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06340.

The pavement crack datasets used in paper, crack detection results on each datasets, trained model, and crack annotation tool are stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y9SxmmFVh0xdQR-wdchUmnScuWMJ5_O-), [One Drive](https://tuprd-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/tug13683_temple_edu/Documents/CrackDataSet/pavement%20crack%20datasets-20210103T153625Z-001.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=cnWIC3), and [Daidu Yunpan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JwJO96BOtJ50MykBcYKknQ) extract code: jviq.

# Installing
1. Install prerequisites for Caffe
2. Clone the repository 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/fyangneil/pavement-crack-detection.git
```
3. Build Caffe
```shell
cd $ROOT_DIR/pavement-crack-detection
make -j8&make pycaffe
```

# Training
The training and test steps are same with HED, please read the instruction in https://github.com/s9xie/hed.
Here we use CRACK500 dataset as an example to demonstrate how to set experiment (assume you have successfully train and test HED on BSD500 dataset).


1. Create a "crack" folder in "pavement-crack-detection/data' folder.
```shell
cd $ROOT_DIR/pavement-crack-detection/data
mkdir crack
```
2. Download CRACK500 and extract it to crack folder and put "train.txt" in "crack" folder. 
3. Download the fully convolutional VGG model (248MB) from [here](http://vcl.ucsd.edu/hed/5stage-vgg.caffemodel) and put it in "pavement-crack-detection/examples/fphb" folder.
4. Train fpn and fphn model on CRACK500 data 
```shell
cd $ROOT_DIR/pavement-crack-detection/examples/fphb
python solve_fphb_crack.py or python solve_fpn_crack.py
  ```

# Test
We use CRACk500 as an example to demonstrate the process of testing the trained model.
1. Download CRACK500 and extract it to "crack" folder and put "test.txt" in "crack" folder.  
2. Test the model
```shell
cd $ROOT_DIR/pavement-crack-detection/examples/fphb
python test.py
```
When testing on one image, you are referred to "pavement-crack-detection/examples/fphb/FPHB-tutorial.ipynb" file.
# Evaluate result
We provide the evaluation tool "eval_tool" to assess the result. Before using the tool, please make sure that in predicted crack map the bright regions are crack, background is black. To get ODS and OIS, run 'crack_nms.m' first then 'crack_eval.m'. To get AIU, run 'crack_AIU.m'.

**If you encounter any issue when using our code or model, feel free to contact me fyang@temple.edu.**
